  <!-- 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      This report is a sample structure for evaluating the <strong>official domain of a local government</strong>
      using publicly available information (OSINT: Open Source Intelligence) and an attacker’s perspective on the
      exposed attack surface. Based on the concept of Active Defense, it summarizes in a technically accurate and
      accountability-oriented way “what is visible from the outside” and “what kinds of risks can be expected around
      web and email.”
    </p>

    <h3>1.1 High-level Assessment</h3>
    <table class="risk-table">
      <tr>
        <th>Item</th><th>Assessment</th><th>Summary</th>

      <tr>
        <td>Attack Surface Exposure</td>
        <td><span class="pill pill-med">Medium</span></td>
        <td>
          The number of exposed subdomains is limited, but email-related configuration and historical traces of
          infrastructure create room for an attacker to gain initial footholds.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Email Security (SPF / DMARC)</td>
        <td><span class="pill pill-high">Needs Improvement</span></td>
        <td>
          An SPF record is configured, but the DMARC policy is set to <code>p=none</code>, which means current
          protection against spoofed emails is not sufficient.
        </td>

      <tr>
        <td>Web / Application</td>
        <td><span class="pill pill-low">Generally Good</span></td>
        <td>
          The web server sends X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, and X-Content-Type-Options headers. From a basic
          security header standpoint, the configuration can be considered standard and reasonably controlled.

    <h3>1.2 Key Risks and Recommendations (Summary)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="term-label">Short</span>
        Gradually strengthen the DMARC policy from <code>p=none</code> to
        <code>quarantine</code> and ultimately to <code>reject</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="term-label">Short</span>
        Review the email-related hostnames and rationalize unused subdomains by decommissioning or redirecting them
        under a clear policy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="term-label">Mid</span>
        Conduct OSINT-based attack surface reviews once or twice a year to clean up stale data such as old DNS records
        and outdated certificates, and to reduce unnecessary exposure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="term-label">Mid</span>
        Introduce mock phishing exercises to measure staff email open and click-through rates, and use the results to
        strengthen security training and internal rules.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="term-label">Long</span>
        Prepare for future 24/7 SOC / MDR engagement by gradually building a logging foundation and an incident
        first-response playbook.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted" style="font-size:12px; margin-top:4px;">
      In simpler terms: the recommended path is (1) improve email anti-spoofing, (2) perform regular clean-up of
      exposed information, and (3) build a bridge toward a full monitoring capability in the future.

  <!-- 2. Scope & Method -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>2. Scope &amp; Methodology</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Scope</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Target domain: Redacted (official local government domain).</li>
      <li>Related subdomains: Multiple subdomains identified through OSINT-based enumeration.</li>
      <li>
        In scope: Attack surface (DNS / web / email), OSINT-based threat reputation, email security settings
        (SPF / DMARC).
      </li>
      <li>
        Out of scope: Internal network scanning, log review, full-scale vulnerability scanning, and intrusive testing.
        This report is strictly limited to an assessment based on publicly available information.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Platforms and Techniques Used</h3>
    <div class="grid-2">
      <div class="card">
        <h4>Attack Surface / OSINT <span class="label label-osint">OSINT</span></h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Cross-referenced multiple OSINT platforms that aggregate public internet data.</li>
          <li>Reviewed DNS records, certificate transparency logs, and Passive DNS datasets.</li>
          <li>Used in-house scripts to enumerate and consolidate subdomains.</li>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>3. Attack Surface Findings</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Subdomain Structure (Example)</h3>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Hostname</th><th>Assumed Role</th><th>Observation</th></tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>[Host A]</code></td>
        <td>Official website</td>
        <td>
          Representative portal host for public web content. Basic security headers are present, and the configuration

      <tr>
        <td><code>[Host B]</code></td>
        <td>Email-related hostname (current usage unclear)</td>
        <td>
          In some cases, DNS entries remain for hostnames that are no longer actively used. From an attacker’s
          perspective, such historical email hostnames can be abused for phishing or social engineering.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><code>[Host C]</code></td>
        <td>External email infrastructure</td>
        <td>
          Represents email delivery infrastructure referenced from the SPF configuration. Clear ownership and
          responsibility boundaries with the provider are important.
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>3.2 Public Service Exposure</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Based on multiple internet-wide scan datasets, no highly sensitive services (for example, RDP or legacy VPN
        devices directly exposed to the internet) were observed.
      </li>
      <li>
        However, certificate logs and DNS history indicate that hostnames historically in use may remain in records.
        These remnants can persist through infrastructure changes and should be considered in future clean-up efforts.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- 4. DNS / Mail Security -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>4. DNS / Email Security (SPF / DMARC)</h2>

    <h3>4.1 SPF Record</h3>
    <div class="card">
      <code>
        SPF: "v=spf1 ip4:***.***.***.0/26 ip4:***.***.***.236 ip4:***.***.***.217 ip4:***.***.***.19
        a:[mail platform hostname] include:[external mail service] -all"
      </code>
    </div>
    <h4>Findings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The SPF record is present and syntactically valid.</strong></li>
      <li>
        Multiple IP addresses and external services are authorized, which suggests that some historical elements may
        still be included.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the longer term, it is advisable to narrow the authorized senders to those actually in use and remove
        obsolete entries, simplifying the SPF configuration and reducing confusion.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.2 DMARC Record</h3>
    <div class="card">
      <code>
        DMARC: "v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:dmarc-report@example.jp"
      </code>
    </div>
    <h4>Findings</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A DMARC record is published, but the policy <code>p=none</code> means it is effectively used for
        <strong>monitoring only</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In this state, receiving mail servers are not instructed to quarantine or reject messages based on DMARC
        results, and therefore the protection against spoofed emails remains limited.
      </li>
      <li>
        We recommend planning a phased transition toward <code>quarantine</code> and eventually
        <code>reject</code>, supported by DMARC reporting analysis and test deployments.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 MX / Blacklist Check</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Major spam blacklists do not currently list the domain or its related IP addresses as malicious.
      </li>
      <li>
        Email operations for local governments often involve prefectural or shared centers. In the event of an
        outage or blacklist listing, it is important to have clear responsibility boundaries among the local government,
        shared centers, and external providers.

        Run mock phishing drills once or twice a year and track trends over time, rather than treating it as a
        one-off exercise.
      </li>
      <li>
        For management and senior staff, emphasize “model behavior” and proper reporting procedures.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider configuring email clients to always show the full sender address and full domain, so suspicious
        senders are easier to recognize.

  <!-- 8. Recommendations -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2>8. Recommendations</h2>

    <h3>8.1 Short Term (0–6 Months)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Start the evaluation and testing needed to gradually move the DMARC policy from
        <code>none</code> to <code>quarantine</code> and ultimately to <code>reject</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Inventory unused subdomains (such as legacy email hostnames), and decide whether to decommission or redirect
        them under a clear policy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Run a proof-of-concept mock phishing exercise and use the outcome to design and prioritize staff
        security awareness training.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put simply, this phase is about “reducing email spoofing risk” by tightening sender configuration and
        strengthening staff awareness.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.2 Mid Term (6–18 Months)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Embed attack surface / OSINT checks into the annual security cycle and treat them as regular “exposure
        clean-ups.”
      </li>
      <li>
        Develop an incident first-response guideline that clearly defines internal roles, reporting lines, and how to
        coordinate with external providers and shared centers.
      </li>
      <li>
        Define a log retention policy (what logs are needed, where they are stored, and how long they are kept).
      </li>
      <li>
        In simpler terms, this phase is about “writing down who does what when something happens,” and ensuring the
        necessary logs are available afterwards.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.3 Long Term (18+ Months)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Build a roadmap that assumes future collaboration with 24/7 SOC / MDR providers, taking into account the split
        of responsibilities between local governments, prefectural bodies, shared centers, and vendors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider a gradual move toward Zero Trust and identity-centric security as cloud adoption (SaaS / IaaS)
        increases.
      </li>
      <li>
        In simpler terms, this phase is about “drawing a long-term map” so that when the organization is ready to work
        with a full monitoring service, the transition is smooth.
      </li>

    <h2>9. Incident First 24 Hours Guide (Summary)</h2>
    <p class="muted">
      The following summarizes the minimum actions recommended during the first 24 hours of a major security incident
      (such as data leakage or external attacks). A more detailed playbook can be prepared as a separate document.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Detection and initial report (0–1 hour)</strong><br>
        Immediately notify the designated internal contact point, classify the suspected incident type, and make an
        initial report to senior management.</li>
      <li><strong>Preliminary impact assessment (1–4 hours)</strong><br>
        Identify affected systems, accounts, and data categories; secure relevant logs; and send early notifications
        to shared centers and key external providers.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical containment (4–12 hours)</strong><br>
        Implement measures such as account lockouts, network segmentation, or temporary suspension of affected
        services to prevent further damage.</li>
      <li><strong>External communication planning (12–24 hours)</strong><br>
        Draft communication for residents and media, prepare FAQs, and set up or confirm a contact point for
        incoming enquiries.</li>
